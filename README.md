# Make Chrome Great Again

## Inspiration

We felt that Donald Trump hasn't been getting enough media coverage lately.

## What It Does

MCGA examines all images on a page. When a face is detected, it is switched out for the beautiful face of the 45th President of the United States of America. If there are any images that cannot be processed, the photo changes to one which properly honors The Donald.

This extension also seeks to erase those who challenge America’s favorite CEO from the history books. When your page tries to show the names of any of Mr. Trump’s foolish challengers, their names are replaced with that of our hero. Certain phrases are replaced with some of Donald’s greatest quotes.

## How We Built It

We hacked around with some JavaScript and alcohol.
